   <div class="rel"> Chicken</div><p>
    Chickens are the most common birds on earth. They are kept for their eggs and for their meat all over the world, from huge farms to people's yards. Hens (female chickens) often live in groups and each hen looks after her own brood (family of chicks), sometimes living in little houses called chicken coops.</p></div>


  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><div class="rel"> Beef</div><p>
   Beef is the meat of cattle (Bos taurus). It is categorized as red meat â€” a term used for the meat of mammals, which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish. Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced.</p></div>
  <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><div class="rel">Sushi</div>

     though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian.</p></div>
