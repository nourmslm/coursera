   <div class="rel"> Chicken</div><p>
    Chickens are the most common birds on earth. They are kept for their eggs and for their meat all over the world, from huge farms to people's yards. Hens (female chickens) often live in groups and each hen looks after her own brood (family of chicks), sometimes living in little houses called chicken coops.</p></div>

   Beef is the meat of cattle (Bos taurus). It is categorized as red meat â€” a term used for the meat of mammals, which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish. Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced.</p></div>
